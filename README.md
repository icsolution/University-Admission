# University-Admission
Reads from a text file filled with student candidates, their grades in individual exams(physics, chemistry, math, computer science), a separate final exam similar to SAT, and choice of enrollment in different majors (Biotech, Chemistry, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics). User selects capacity for each major, and algorithm places individual students based their priority choices, average grades of combined exam requirement for each major, or final SAT score depending on which is greater. Lastly, the program outputs results in the console, simultaneously saving each major listing of accepted students in seperate files.
